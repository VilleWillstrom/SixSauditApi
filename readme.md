# SixSauditApi

SixSauditApi is the backend for a 6S auditing app, developed in Python using the FastAPI framework. While the project is currently under development, it is fully runnable for demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you'll need Xampp or an equivalent method to host a MySQL database.

The software leverages the FastAPI framework and integrates SQLAlchemy to connect to the database. This simplifies the setup process as you only need to initialize a fresh database, and SQLAlchemy will handle the rest during the initial usage.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or equivalent
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version X.X.X)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Open the Project Folder:

- Open the project folder in the editor of your choice.

### 2. Create a `.env` File:

- Create a new file in the project root and name it `.env`.
- Copy the lines from `.envexample` and paste them into `.env`.
- Provide a random string for `JWT_SECRET` in `.env`.
- Add the direct path to your fresh database to `CONNECTION_STRING` in `.env` after the `mysql+mysqlconnector://` text.

### 3. Install Packages:

- Ensure you are in a virtual environment.
- Open the command prompt and navigate to the root of this project.
- Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  This installs the required packages from `requirements.txt`, ensuring you have all the necessary dependencies.

### 4. Create a Static Folder:

- Create a new folder in the project root and name it `static`.
  This folder is where the API stores all static files uploaded to the server.

### 5. Create SSL HTTPS for Localhost:

- Follow [this tutorial](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-get-ssl-https-for-localhost/) to create the `cert` folder in the project root and continue with the tutorial to provision an SSL certificate for the local server.

### 6. Run Alembic Upgrade Head Command:

- Navigate to the project root directory using the command prompt and execute the following command:
`alembic upgrade head` This command initializes the database by applying any pending migrations, creating the necessary tables on your fresh database.

- Ensure the database is properly set up before proceeding to the next steps.

### 7. Run the Program:

- Ensure you are at the project root.
- Run the command `python main.py`.
- Open the app from the link shown in the terminal.
- Navigate to the `/docs` page (e.g., `localhost:8002/docs`).
  You should now see the API documentation.
